## Introduction
This project utilizes LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to predict future stock prices of AAPL (Apple Inc.). LSTM is chosen for its ability to handle sequential data and is well-suited for time series forecasting tasks.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes historical AAPL stock prices. Each data point comprises:
- Date
- Opening price
- Closing price
- Highest price
- Lowest price
- Volume
- adjClose
- adjHigh
- adjLow
- adjOpen
- adjVolume
- divCash
- splitFactor

## Model Architecture
The LSTM model architecture is structured as follows:
- Input Layer
- LSTM Layers 
- Dense Layer


## Results
The model's performance is evaluated based on standard metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). And ploted the prediction.
